TERMINATED/DEAD
When all the statements inside a thread's run() method have been been completed, that thread is said to have terminated.

A thread can be in any one of the remaining three states, after its start() method has been invoked.
RUNNING: If the thread is currently running.

RUNNABLE: If the thread is not currently running, but is ready to do so at any time.

BLOCKED/WAITING: If the thread is not currently running on the processor, but is not ready to execute either. This may be the case if it's waiting for an external resource (such as a user's input) or another thread.
